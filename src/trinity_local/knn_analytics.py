"""k-NN advisory analytics — production observability for the advisory layer.

Tracks every k-NN advisory call and provides aggregated reporting for:
  1. Evidence spam: how many evidence lines are being appended?
  2. Threshold brittleness: does council_confidence behave consistently
     across task kinds and provider pairs?
  3. Product metrics: "acted on suggestion" and "later switched anyway"

Log is append-only JSONL at ~/.trinity/analytics/knn_advisory.jsonl
