"""Single-source-of-truth registry for provider slugs + MCP tool names.

The motivation (council_76e5aef79bb9f241 #1): names that recur across
modules drifted multiple times during development — provider slug
sets were inlined as tuples in 4+ places, MCP tool names lived only
inside ``mcp_server.py`` string literals, and the canonical counts in
``claude.md`` drifted from the source of truth more than once. This
module consolidates the canonical groupings as importable symbols so
new call sites adopt them by reference rather than by copy-paste.

Four distinct groupings — they share members but serve different
purposes, and conflating them is a real drift source. Each name below
is the set used by a specific Trinity subsystem:

- ``CANONICAL_COUNCIL_PROVIDERS`` — the 3 frontier-lab CLIs that play
  council member roles. Re-exported from ``config`` for back-compat.
- ``CANONICAL_LAB_PROVIDERS`` — 4 entries: council trio + ``gemini``
  (the consumer Gemini app via takeout/capture, distinct from the
  ``antigravity`` CLI). Used by cortex frontmatter filters that need
  to know "did this field name a provider we know about?"
- ``CAPTURE_PROVIDERS`` — the 3 web-chat surfaces with browser-
  extension capture adapters (``claude``, ``chatgpt``, ``gemini``).
  Different from CANONICAL_LAB_PROVIDERS — ``chatgpt`` here maps to
  the OpenAI consumer app; ``codex`` is the CLI sibling and lives in
  the CANONICAL_LAB_PROVIDERS set.
- ``MCP_TOOL_NAMES`` — the 9 tools registered in ``mcp_server.py``.
  Tested for drift against the actual ``handle_list_tools()`` output.

# This is what makes "the extension auto-wires itself to Trinity" possible:
# install.sh pre-registers the native-messaging host for THIS id, so when
# the user installs the published extension (which has this fixed id) the
# host is already there and the extension connects on first run. A bare
# native-messaging host only accepts connections whose origin is in its
# allowed_origins, so the id MUST match the installed extension.
#
# Today this is the id Chrome assigned to the locally-loaded unpacked build.
# On Web Store publish, replace it with the assigned store id (the store id
# is fixed forever once published). The bash resolver
# (scripts/launcher_path_resolver.sh) hard-codes the same value as its
# default — `test_extension_id_sync` keeps the two in lockstep.
