"""Registry of retired CLI names, MCP tools, modules, and concepts.

Gap B from docs/architectural-gaps.md: retirement is narrated everywhere
(claude.md, MIGRATION.md, simplification_log.md, inline comments) but
declared nowhere. Iter #68/#69 caught MIGRATION.md internally
contradicting itself ("keep `shortcut-install`" vs "the CLI no longer
exists") 20 lines apart. The narration doesn't talk to itself.

This module declares retirements as structured data so:
- Tests can grep for present-tense references to retired names
  (sweep pattern #27 as automated guard)
- ``trinity-local <retired-cli>`` can show a friendly migration message
  rather than ``unknown command``
- Docs can reference the registry at render time instead of restating

Schema:
    RetirementRecord(retired_at, commit, replacement, reason, kind,
                     artifact_persists)

When adding a retirement: add the entry here in the same commit as
the deletion. Don't narrate the retirement in 5 places + forget the
registry — the registry IS the source of truth.
