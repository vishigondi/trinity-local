"""Heuristic search over PromptNodes — no embedding model required.

`search_prompt_nodes(query, top_k)` ranks past prompts by:
  - substring/token overlap with the query (0..1)
  - recency (exponential decay, 30-day half-life)
  - theme tags (HIGH_VALUE_THEMES bonus)
  - council count (already-evaluated prompts have demonstrated value)
  - user-override signal (chairman_winner != user_winner = high replay value)
  - hardness (replay_value heuristics)
  - staleness penalty (recently-run prompts get pushed down)

Empty query = lens-build sampling mode (rank by replay-value heuristics only).

This is the embedding-free fast path. Trinity's product surface (launchpad
autofill, MCP search_prompts, lens-build sampling, replay-history candidates)
does not load nomic-embed-v1.5 or any ML model. Net: 22s cold-start → <100ms,
RSS drops by ~150MB. Embeddings stay available in the `embeddings/` package
for research/k-NN tooling that explicitly opts in.
