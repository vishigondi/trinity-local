"""Embedding layer for Trinity Local.

Public API:
    embed(text)       → list[float]   (MLX if available, TF-IDF fallback)
    embed_batch(texts) → list[list[float]]  (batched, 10-50× faster on MLX)
    similarity(a, b)  → float         (cosine similarity)
    is_available()    → bool          (True if MLX backend loaded)
    get_backend()     → str           ("mlx" | "tfidf")

This package is imported by both the product path (watch_runtime) and
the research path (research/ranking). It owns model loading and inference.

The persistent embedding cache (`~/.trinity/cache/embeddings.jsonl`) was
retired 2026-05-17 in the pre-launch simplification pass. With the
embedding-powered search hot-path already removed (Tier 1 #4), the only
remaining consumers are the offline rebuild commands (`dream`,
`lens-build`, `vocabulary`, `consolidate`); each pass re-encodes its
own corpus, which costs ~2 min on a 50k-prompt corpus but saves a
persistent state file, an unbounded growth gotcha, and two CLI surfaces
(`cache-stats`, `cache-clear`). Re-introduce an in-memory cache here
if power-user perf complaints surface post-launch.
