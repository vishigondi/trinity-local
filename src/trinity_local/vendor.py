"""Vendored JS dependencies for the launchpad + memory viewer + council
review pages.

100-persona audit P06 fix: prior cuts loaded marked / petite-vue /
chart.js / 9 d3-* modules from unpkg + jsdelivr on every page open.
That contradicted the "never leaves your machine" privacy absolute —
each launchpad render reached out to 13 third-party CDNs, exposing
the user's IP + a browser fingerprint to mirrors that have no business
in the Trinity wedge.

This module publishes the same files locally:

- Bundled into the wheel under ``src/trinity_local/data/vendor/*.js``
  via the package-data declaration in pyproject.toml.
- Copied into ``~/.trinity/portal_pages/vendor/`` on each portal-html
  regen (idempotent, content-hash-skip when up-to-date).
- HTML templates reference ``./vendor/<file>.js`` instead of CDN URLs.

Net result: launchpad + memory viewer + council review all render with
zero outbound network traffic. The privacy claim becomes absolutely
true, not "absolutely true except 13 JS files."

Refreshing the vendored set is a maintenance ritual (when a new d3
version ships): edit + run ``scripts/refresh-vendor.sh``. The script
pins every URL with an explicit version; treat version bumps as
security-sensitive (the rendered HTML is what the user sees offline,
so the bytes have to be auditable). After refresh, re-run
``pytest tests/test_no_cdn_in_rendered_html.py`` — the 5 guards there
re-render launchpad + memory-viewer and check zero unpkg/jsdelivr
references make it into the produced HTML.

    """Convert petite-vue's ES-module build into a plain IIFE.

    WHY: Chrome treats every ``file://`` URL as a unique origin, so
    ``<script type="module"> import {createApp} from './vendor/...'``
    fails CORS on the launchpad and the page renders raw `{{ }}` Vue
    templates instead of interpolating. Headless smoke (different
    flags) hides the bug. The IIFE form loads via plain ``<script
    src="...">`` and exposes the same surface on ``window.__TRINITY_VUE__``.

    Transformation: locate petite-vue's trailing
    ``export{Qe as createApp,V as nextTick,D as reactive};``
    statement and rewrite it to ``window.__TRINITY_VUE__={...};``
    so the same internal bindings ride the global. Then wrap the
    whole body in a `(function(){ ... })()` so the file's top-level
    `let/const` declarations stay scoped.

    If the export line shape ever changes (petite-vue version bump),
    we fall back to returning the original bytes — the launchpad will
    keep using the module path. The doc-consistency guard in
    ``tests/test_no_cdn_in_rendered_html.py`` covers a separate axis
    (no CDN), so this graceful degradation won't be silent: the new
    Vue-mount smoke (added alongside this fix) flags it.
