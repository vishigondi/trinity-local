"""Model-launch detection (#218) — the local-first signal that a new model
shipped, so Trinity can nudge the user to score it against their taste.

The whole celebration loop is **detect → notify → eval → eval-card**. This
module is the *detect* half. There is no server: the canonical current model
per provider ships in ``data/models.json`` and rides Trinity releases (the
user receives a bump via ``trinity-local update``). ``detect_new_models()``
diffs that manifest against the model the user *last evaluated* — recorded as
``target_model`` on each eval run (authoritative since v1.7.40 made the
recorded model equal the dispatched one). A provider whose current model
hasn't been scored yet is a "score it against YOUR taste" opportunity — the
viral, lab-impossible artifact.

The *notify* half surfaces these in ``trinity-local status`` + the launchpad
(no new CLI verb — the surface stays collapsed to lens/council). The *eval*
half is the existing ``eval-run --target <name>`` (now alias-friendly via
``resolve_provider_alias``). The *card* half is the existing eval-card.
