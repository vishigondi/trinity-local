"""trinity-local install — discovery surface for install verbs.

Symmetric with `commands/debug.py`. The cron spec's 5-user-facing list
mentions `install` as a single verb, but today the install module
registers five separate subparsers (install-mcp, install-hooks,
install-extension, install-launcher, uninstall). This umbrella
advertises them so `trinity-local install` is the discoverable entry
point; the bare names still work (the launchpad's install-extension
dispatch and the README's `install-mcp` examples don't break).

Module name is `install_umbrella` to avoid colliding with the
existing `install` module that registers the *-mcp/*-hooks/etc.
subparsers.
