"""Per-provider failure-mode tracking — read recent dispatch outcomes and
deprioritize providers in active failure states.

When a provider is currently rate-limited, billing-exceeded, or auth-failed,
routing decisions should treat it as last-resort even if its long-term
trust score says otherwise. This module reads the dispatch_outcomes.jsonl
log (written by ask.run_ask) and surfaces a set of "currently unhealthy"
providers for the routing layer to demote.

Design choices:

- **In-process cache, short TTL.** Reading the JSONL every call is cheap
  (the file is appended-only and small) but unnecessary on bursts of asks.
  Cache for 30s.
- **Time-bounded failure windows.** A rate-limit at 9am tells you nothing
  at 11am. Each failure kind has its own decay:
    rate_limited: 10 min  (most providers reset within minutes)
    billing_exceeded: 24 hr (manual fix usually)
    auth_failed: 24 hr (manual re-auth usually)
    timeout: 5 min (transient infra)
    model_not_found: forever (config bug)
- **Threshold to call something unhealthy.** A single rate-limit hit might
  be a glitch; 3+ in the window is a sustained signal. Configurable.
