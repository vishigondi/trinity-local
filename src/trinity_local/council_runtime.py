    DESIGN HOLE (digital-twin vision, 2026-05-16): this function returns
    the SAME prompt for every member. The chairman is lens-conditioned
    (reads core.md before synthesis) but the dispatch is not — each
    model receives the raw user prompt with no taste-derived twist.

    The vision (per the user's persona-twin framing): each member's
    prompt should be twisted the way the user would twist it, derived
    from the lens + scoreboards. Example shape when adopted:

        render_member_prompt(bundle, provider_name="claude", lens=...)
        → prepends "User has historically rejected over-engineered
           answers (COMPRESSION rejection signal n=8, mean 0.50 on
           your corpus). Prefer the tightest answer that lands."
        render_member_prompt(bundle, provider_name="antigravity", lens=...)
        → prepends "User's REFRAME rejection rate on your corpus is
           low — don't pivot the question, answer it."

    Inputs already on disk: ~/.trinity/me/rejections.jsonl (per-axis
    rejection signal — lens-pipeline internals dir), ~/.trinity/memories/lens.md
    (paired tensions — cognitive-lens artifact the chairman reads),
    ~/.trinity/scoreboard/picks.json (per-task_type winner rules).

    Not implemented yet. When implemented, callers in council_runner.py
    must pass provider_name + lens; today they call this with bundle
    alone and get a shared prompt.
