"""Cold-start auto-scan of local CLI transcripts on first MCP spawn.

The wow flow needs personalization on the first council, not a week
later. The four local-CLI parsers (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity,
Cowork) all read from on-disk dirs the user already has — so the
moment Trinity's MCP child starts under a brand-new install, we can
auto-detect "no corpus + at least one CLI source present" and kick a
background scan. The server keeps serving tool calls immediately;
tool responses surface a `cold_start_scan` hint so the agent can tell
the user "I'm ingesting your CLI history…" while the scan runs.

Privacy invariant: same data path as the retired `seed-from-taste-terminal`
(replaced by `import-export` 2026-05-27). Only walks transcript dirs
the user already owns on this machine. No exports, no network, no
opt-in dialog. Same `incremental_ingest`
pipeline so dedup / cursors / parser fallthrough behavior is shared.

Disable for tests + CI with ``TRINITY_AUTOSCAN_DISABLED=1``; the
conftest autouse fixture sets it so tests never scan the developer's
real ``~/.claude/``.
