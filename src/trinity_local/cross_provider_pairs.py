"""Find questions the user asked across providers, group them by semantic
similarity, and surface as bootstrap material for the cortex.

Every PromptNode the seed pipeline produces carries the user's prompt
text, the assistant's response (preceding/following_assistant_text), AND
an embedding. The data needed to compare "what claude said when I asked
X" vs "what gemini said when I asked the same X" already exists on disk
— Trinity just hasn't been mining it.

This module does the mining: O(N²) cosine sim within each task_type
bucket (cheap at ~thousands of nodes per bucket), groups embeddings
above a configurable threshold into clusters, drops clusters that don't
span ≥ 2 providers, returns the cross-provider clusters as candidates
for synthetic-council generation.

Why not k-NN graph + connected components: the bootstrap pass runs
once or rarely; O(N²) finishes in seconds at the basin sizes that
matter, and the simpler code makes the discovery semantics auditable
("this pair clustered because cosine = 0.87" is trivially explainable).

    Algorithm:
      1. Filter to nodes WITH embeddings AND assistant response text.
      2. Stack embeddings + L2-normalize once. Each seed's cosine
         against all others is then a single BLAS matmul (microseconds
         per seed instead of milliseconds — 100× speedup over
         element-by-element Python).
      3. Greedy clustering: for each node, find all other nodes whose
         embedding similarity >= threshold. Form a cluster.
      4. Drop clusters that don't span ``min_providers`` distinct
         providers (intra-provider near-duplicates aren't useful).
      5. Keep one response per provider per cluster (the highest-similarity
         to the representative) — synthetic councils don't want 5 claude
         responses, they want one per provider.
      6. Cap cluster size for the chairman prompt budget.
