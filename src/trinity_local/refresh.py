    Class of bug: user clicks "Launch Council" on the launchpad → task record

    the actual council subprocess fails silently (Shortcut not installed,
    permission denied, etc.) → task stays `running` forever. Found 6 such
    tasks aged 8–10 days during the UI smoke loop (`a council is stuck?`).

    Reap criteria: status in {running/pending/dispatched/in_progress},
    no bundle_id assigned (never reached the council runner), older than
    `stale_after_minutes`. Anything WITH a bundle_id is left alone — those
    might be legit in-flight work we shouldn't abort blindly.
