"""Pure-numerical helpers for the cortex consolidation pass.

Extracted from cortex.py to keep the routing/schema concerns there focused
on orchestration. Everything in this module is dependency-free Python math
(stdlib only) — no scipy, no numpy in production paths, no awareness of
RoutingPattern. The one impure function (`compute_basin_geometry`) is
included because it composes the math on top of evidence embeddings and
returns the structured geometric prior the flagship extraction prompt
conditions on; isolating it here makes the basin-shape contract a single
file's worth of code.

Public symbols:
- ``compute_basin_geometry(outcomes) -> dict``
- ``weiszfeld_median(points) -> list[float]``
- ``participation_ratio(points, center) -> float``
- ``project_onto_first_pc(points, center) -> list[float]``
- ``mean_cosine_to(center, points) -> float``
- ``excess_kurtosis(values) -> float``
- ``euclid(a, b) -> float``
- Constants: ``BIMODALITY_KURTOSIS_THRESHOLD``, ``MANIFOLD_DIM_SATURATION``

The underscore-prefixed aliases (``_weiszfeld_median``, etc.) are kept so
existing imports `from .cortex import _weiszfeld_median` continue to work
when cortex.py re-exports them.
