"""Append-only log of tacit-record acts.

Trinity already mines one merge corpus (council winner selection via
`council_feedback.jsonl` + `council_outcomes/*.json`). The strategic
direction is to grow that into a unified log of every "user expressed
a preference by acting" moment, then compute downstream views (lens,
picks, routing, direction-of-preference vectors) over the same flat
substrate. Same pattern as the existing `council_outcomes/` canonical
store + `compute_personal_routing_table` computed view.

This module is the writer side. Consumers (lens-build,
personal_routing, future v1.5 direction-of-preference vectors) read
the log later via `iter_merge_records()`.

Schema is open — each record carries `type` + arbitrary additional
fields. v1.0 ships with the council-winner row only; other merge
shapes (in-thread overwrite, override → re-consolidation delta,
agent-diff accept/reject) get added as the corresponding callers
are wired up.

Cold-install path: the directory + file are created lazily on first
write. Reading from a non-existent log returns an empty iterator.
