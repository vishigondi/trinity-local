"""Stage 1 — topology via numpy k-means over PromptNode embeddings.

Produces ~20 basins per `lens-build`. Each basin carries:
- id (b00..bNN)
- size (count of prompts in cluster)
- top_terms (top-3 TF-IDF residual phrases vs full corpus)
- centroid (768d numpy vector)
- prompt_ids (sample for stage 2 to walk)

Two consumers:
1. Stage 2 tags each extracted decision with its basin id.
2. Stage 4 post-filter drops accepted pairs whose tension evidence
   all sits in a single basin (topic-local virtue, not real lens).

NOT a chairman input — the council ratified that passing basin ids
through the prompt is dead-code-prone unless deterministic code uses
them. Per-decision tagging + post-filter together fix that.
