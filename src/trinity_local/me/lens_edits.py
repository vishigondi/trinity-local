"""Capture user edits to ``~/.trinity/memories/lens.md`` as preference signal.

When the user opens lens.md and edits a line by hand, that's the strongest
possible taste signal Trinity can collect — stronger than rejection signal
extracted from transcripts, stronger than chairman-derived would_flip_if.
The user is *actively asserting* taste, not just pushing back on something
the model produced.

This module is the capture side of #140. Mechanism:

1. After every successful ``lens-build``, write a snapshot of lens.md to
   ``~/.trinity/me/lens_snapshot.md``.
2. At the start of the *next* ``lens-build``, diff the current lens.md
   against that snapshot. Any difference = user edit since last build.
3. Persist each line-level delta as one JSON line in
   ``~/.trinity/me/lens_edits.jsonl``: ``{ts, op, before, after, source}``.

The feed-back side (next dream cycle reads the JSONL and weights edits
heavier in Stage 2 corpus) is a separate slice.

Edge cases:
- No snapshot file (cold start, or first-ever lens-build): no edits
  captured — there's nothing to diff against. The post-build write
  establishes the baseline for next time.
- Snapshot identical to current: no edits captured.
- lens.md missing: skip silently (lens-build is what creates it).
