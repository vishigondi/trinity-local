"""Stage 3 — pair mining via 3-member council + verifier contract.
Stage 4 — deterministic basin post-filter.

Three members propose pair candidates from `decisions.jsonl`. The
chairman applies the three tests as a JSON contract:
- TENSION: decisions in BOTH directions (A privileged sacrificing B,
  AND B privileged sacrificing A).
- DUAL EVIDENCE: regret/correction/cost on BOTH poles (any of the
  expanded valence values per council_c63fa273bdc2ed21).
- FAILURE-MODE LEGIBILITY: a named failure for pure-A and pure-B
  (paralysis / hedonism / theater / sterility / ...).

Verdict per pair: accepted | preserve_as_ordering | dropped.

Stage 4 applies a deterministic post-filter on top: any pair whose
tension evidence sits entirely in ONE basin gets demoted to
preserve_as_ordering. Council council_70eaf228d7753074 ratified this
as the load-bearing piece — without it, basin tags are dead code.

Output:
- `~/.trinity/me/lenses.json` — accepted pairs (4–8 expected)
- `~/.trinity/me/orderings.json` — preserve_as_ordering pairs

    return f"""You are mining lens-pairs from a user's decisions.

A LENS is a tension between two value poles (A, B) where:
1. TENSION — decisions privilege A at B's cost AND vice versa (both directions).
2. DUAL EVIDENCE — regret/correction/cost shows up on BOTH poles
   (the user has stated downsides of over-indexing on each pole).
3. FAILURE-MODE LEGIBILITY — a named failure mode for pure-A AND pure-B
   (e.g., paralysis, hedonism, theater, sterility, performance, avoidance).

If only ONE direction has evidence, it's a virtue or an ordering, not a lens.
If failure-modes are unnameable on either pole, it's a virtue, not a lens.

CRITICAL: ABSTRACT THE POLES. Each pole must be a STRUCTURAL pattern that
recurs across multiple domains, not a literal phrase from one decision.

GENERATOR-OVER-GENERATED — when two candidate pole names BOTH pass the
cross-basin test, pick the one that DERIVES the other. The generator
beats the generated. The rule beats the instance produced by the rule.

Tests for "is A the generator of B?":
- Can you reach B by applying A to a domain? (Yes → A is the generator.)
- Does A explain WHY B is also true? (Yes → A is upstream.)
- Could A have produced B, but not the reverse? (Yes → emit A.)

Examples:
  candidates: "shipping velocity over polish"  vs  "executable artifact over description of one"
    → "executable artifact over description" GENERATES "shipping velocity over polish"
    (shipping fast IS one instance of preferring the executable form)
    → emit "executable artifact over description of one".

  candidates: "user ownership of data over lab pipeline"  vs  "source over derivative"
    → "source over derivative" GENERATES the data-ownership preference
    (owning your data IS choosing the source over the lab's derivative)
    → emit "source over derivative".

When two pass the cross-basin test, ask: "which one sounds like it could
have been emitted by the OTHER one's rule?" That direction names the
generator. Emit it; demote the other to a cross-link or drop it.

BAD pole names (too literal, single domain — REJECT these):
  ❌ "speed/momentum to close"           → too specific to a real-estate deal
  ❌ "lower buyer-agent fee"             → one transaction
  ❌ "frigate setup over usb mount"      → one home automation task
  ❌ "settle the prior determination"    → too narrow

GOOD pole names (structural, span 3+ domains):
  ✓ "infrastructure over interface"          (architecture, software, smart-home)
  ✓ "locked corpus over forward theory"      (genetics, geopolitics, tax, SEO)
  ✓ "temporal trajectory over present snapshot"  (materials, real-estate, tax)
  ✓ "full-stack control over component excellence" (manufacturing, kit business, travel)
  ✓ "generative grammar over selected instance"    (floor-plans, genetics, philosophy)
  ✓ "codified rule over aesthetic judgment"        (genetics, design, manifestos)

THE TEST: would two strangers reading this lens converge on the same answer
in a domain you've never discussed? If a pole only fits one topical area, it's
a preference, not a lens. Name the structural move that ties decisions across
DIFFERENT basins together.

Cross-basin requirement: your tension_decisions for any "accepted" pair must
draw from AT LEAST 2 distinct basin ids (b00..bNN in the decisions below).
Pairs whose evidence sits in one basin are topic preferences — emit them as
"preserve_as_ordering" instead of "accepted".

Propose 6–12 candidate pairs from the decisions below. For each pair, return
a verdict object — JSON array, one element per pair, schema below:

{{
  "pole_a": "<short noun phrase, the optimized-for axis>",
  "pole_b": "<short noun phrase, the traded-away axis>",
  "failure_a": "<one-word or short phrase named failure of pure-A>",
  "failure_b": "<one-word or short phrase named failure of pure-B>",
  "tension_decisions": ["<decision_id where A privileged>", "<decision_id where B privileged>", ...],
  "dual_evidence": {{
    "pole_a": ["<decision_id with regret/correction/cost on A>", ...],
    "pole_b": ["<decision_id with regret/correction/cost on B>", ...]
  }},
  "horizon": "tactical | strategic | philosophical",
  "verdict": "accepted | preserve_as_ordering | dropped"
}}

HORIZON GUIDE — what time-scale does this lens operate at?
- tactical: response-format / turn-scale preferences. ("be terse vs
  comprehensive", "code first vs explanation first", "JSON vs prose")
- strategic: quarter-scale trajectory / project-level direction.
  ("ship MVP over polish", "build leverage over manual ops",
  "specialize over generalize")
- philosophical: year-scale identity / framing / world-model.
  ("intelligence is infrastructure not interface", "patient capital
  over conventional venture", "generative grammar over selected
  instance")

If unsure: prefer "strategic". Don't claim "philosophical" unless
the lens reframes how the user sees a whole domain.

VERDICT GUIDE:
- accepted: passes all three tests
- preserve_as_ordering: stable preference (A always over B) but no
  dual evidence — useful as a lookup, not a lens
- dropped: neither tension nor dual evidence; a virtue or noise

Output: ONE JSON array. NO commentary outside the array. NO markdown fences.
