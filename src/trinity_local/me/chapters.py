"""Life chapters — datable episodes in the user's history (#252).

Deterministic, no LLM. Buckets prompts by month (via the TRUE conversation
`timestamp`, not the ingest `created_at` — the latter collapses a multi-year
corpus into the single month it was indexed), assigns each to its topic basin,
and surfaces contiguous month-runs where a basin's share spikes well above its
all-time baseline. Those runs are the user's "chapters": the smart-home build,
the real-estate deal, the frontend phase that ended.

This is the cross-time TOPIC view — complementary to the dormant within-thread
trajectory lens (#182). It is also the measurement the decay-aware lens needs:
a tension that spans many chapters is a durable trait (keep); one confined to an
old chapter is a phase that passed (decay).
