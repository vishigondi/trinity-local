"""Stage 2 — decision extraction (one chairman call).

Walk MMR-sampled chunks, ask the chairman to surface every
decision-shaped utterance with structured tags. Output is
`~/.trinity/me/decisions.jsonl` — one JSON line per decision.

Schema:
{
  "id": "d_001",
  "privileged": "<what got optimized for>",
  "sacrificed": "<what got traded away>",
  "valence": "satisfaction|regret|unresolved|correction|cost",
  "basin": "<basin id from stage 1>",
  "verbatim": "<≤25 word excerpt from user turn>",
  "prompt_id": "<originating PromptNode id>"
}

Why valence has 5 values, not 3: literal regret quotes are rare; real
lens evidence often shows up as a correction ("ok that's wrong, do X
instead") or a stated cost ("this approach gives up Y"). Council
council_c63fa273bdc2ed21 ratified expanding the enum so the three
tests don't reject real lenses for lacking explicit regret.

A "decision" is any moment where the user CHOSE, DECLINED, REGRETTED,
RATIONALIZED, or COURSE-CORRECTED. Walk the chunks below and surface every
decision you find. Skip neutral or purely informational prompts.

CRITICAL: When labelling `privileged` and `sacrificed`, abstract one level
ABOVE the literal phrases in the verbatim. The downstream pair-miner needs
poles that recur across domains, not labels tied to one decision.

  Verbatim: "let's just pay 2% to the buyer agent and close fast"
  ❌ literal: privileged="lower buyer-agent fee", sacrificed="agent goodwill"
  ✓ abstract: privileged="momentum to close", sacrificed="relational reciprocity"

  Verbatim: "intelligence is infrastructure, not interface"
  ❌ literal: privileged="infrastructure", sacrificed="interface"
  ✓ abstract: privileged="capability hidden in structure", sacrificed="capability surfaced as features"

  Verbatim: "use the punnett square always, not the ratio"
  ❌ literal: privileged="punnett square", sacrificed="ratio"
  ✓ abstract: privileged="generative mechanism shown", sacrificed="derived shortcut"

If you can't abstract a decision (it's too domain-specific to generalize),
skip it rather than emit a literal label.

For each decision, emit ONE JSON line in this exact schema:

{{"id": "d_001", "privileged": "<what was optimized for>", "sacrificed": "<what was traded away>", "valence": "satisfaction|regret|unresolved|correction|cost", "basin": "<basin id from list below>", "verbatim": "<≤25 word excerpt from the chunk>", "prompt_id": "<the [id] from the chunk header>"}}

Valence guide:
- satisfaction: explicit endorsement of the trade
- regret: explicit regret over the trade
- unresolved: ambivalent or still-deliberating
- correction: course-correction ("no, do X instead")
- cost: stated trade-off cost ("this gives up Y")

Use correction or cost when the user shows lens evidence without literal
regret words — both count as valid evidence for pair mining.

Basins from the user's corpus (id : top terms · size):
{basin_summary}

Hard cap: emit at most 80 decisions. Prefer high-signal ones (clear pole,
explicit trade-off) over weak ones. Skip chunks with no decision shape.

Output format: ONE JSON object per line, NO commentary, NO markdown
fences, NO blank lines. Each line must parse as JSON.
