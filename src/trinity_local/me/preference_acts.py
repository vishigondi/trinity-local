"""Unified preference-act evidence type — Stage 1 of the EXTRACT
unification (docs/lens-redesign.md beauty audit).

The lens pipeline extracts user taste through two passes that are really
one shape:

- **Stage 0 rejections** (`RejectionSignal`): the model offered X, the
  user substituted Y. REFRAME / REDIRECT / COMPRESSION / SHARPENING.
- **Stage 2 decisions** (`Decision`): the user privileged value A over
  value B, with a valence (satisfaction / regret / …).

A rejection *is* a decision — the user privileged their substitute over
the model's offering. Decisions ⊇ rejections; a rejection is the
model-miss-triggered subset. The beautiful form is **one evidence type
with a `trigger` discriminator**:

- `trigger="model_miss"`   ← rejections (model got it wrong, user fixed it)
- `trigger="self_expressed"` ← decisions (user stated a trade-off directly)

This module is the **read/type layer** of the unification (Strangler-Fig
step 1): it introduces `PreferenceAct` + adapters from the two existing
shapes + a unified reader over the two existing on-disk stores. The
writers (Stage 0 → rejections.jsonl, Stage 2 → decisions.jsonl), the
eval harness, and provider-import are all UNCHANGED at this stage — they
keep their current schemas. Later stages merge the extraction pass and
migrate storage. Doing it this way means each stage is independently
shippable and reversible, and the risky storage migration comes last,
after the type is proven on real data.
