# Third-Party Notices

Trinity Local itself is released under the MIT License (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)).

This file credits the third-party components that Trinity Local bundles or
relies on. Only components that are actually present in this repository or
downloaded at runtime are listed. All of them carry permissive licenses
(MIT / BSD / ISC / Apache-2.0 / HPND).

## Embedding model (downloaded at runtime, not bundled)

Trinity's real embedding path uses a single model, pulled once via
`trinity-local download-embedder` and then loaded offline from the local
Hugging Face cache. It is **not** vendored in this repository.

| Component | License | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `nomic-ai/modernbert-embed-base` | Apache-2.0 | https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/modernbert-embed-base |

## Bundled browser JavaScript (`src/trinity_local/data/vendor/`)

These 12 minified files are vendored into the package and published into
`~/.trinity/portal_pages/vendor/` for the local launchpad, memory viewer,
and council review pages (all served over `file://` — no CDN).
