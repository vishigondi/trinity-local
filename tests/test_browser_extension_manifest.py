"""Structural validation for browser-extension/manifest.json.

Catches manifest typos and broken file references BEFORE the user runs
"Load Unpacked" in chrome://extensions (where Chrome's error messages
are terse and the failure mode is silent capture). Same principle as
the doc-consistency guards in test_doc_count_consistency.py: every
claim has a regression guard at the surface that ships it.

Validates:
* Required MV3 fields are present
* Every file referenced (background service worker, content_scripts
  js arrays) actually exists in browser-extension/
* MAIN-world content_scripts list adapters/<provider>.js BEFORE
  page-hook.js (load order matters — page-hook reads from
  window.__TRINITY_ADAPTERS which adapters populate)
* Host permissions cover all four target sites
* minimum_chrome_version is high enough for MAIN-world content_scripts
