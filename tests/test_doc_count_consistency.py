"""Meta-test: load-bearing counts stay in sync across docs.

Principle #20 (duplicated facts drift in the oldest surface)
formalized in tick #89. The pattern surfaced 3× this session — each
time a numeric claim was correct in some surfaces and stale in
others (a stale claim in the OLDEST surface, specifically). The
fix shape: enforce that every place a count is pinned agrees with
every other place, so future-me catches the drift at test time
instead of grep time.

This guard scans the three known duplicate surfaces for the test
count and the smoke-surface count, and asserts they agree
internally. Doesn't enforce a SPECIFIC value — that would require
running pytest first to know what number to expect. Internal
consistency is the regression target; "all stale together" is still
a green test, but a tick that bumps one number without bumping the
others fails loudly.

Per principle #14 (every shipped feature gets a smoke regression
guard within one tick): tick #89 shipped the principle; this ticks
the guard.
