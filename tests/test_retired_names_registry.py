"""Gap B — Retirement registry guard.

Two invariants:

1. **Registry integrity.** Every record in ``RETIRED`` has a valid date,
   declared kind, and (if it claims a replacement) the replacement is a
   real CLI/MCP-tool that currently exists.

2. **No present-tense references in docs/code.** For each retired name,
   scan docs and code for present-tense framing (\"X does Y\", \"X prints\")
   in non-historical context. Past-tense (\"X was retired\", \"if you
   previously ran X\") is fine.

The second invariant is the iter #68/#69 catch shape made automatic.
