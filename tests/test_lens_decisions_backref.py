"""Regression: the launchpad lens card must expose decisions.jsonl as
a clickable backref row under each paired lens.

The README pledge: "If it can't show its work, it doesn't get to claim
the thought." Every lens claim's `tension_decisions` IDs (e.g. d_001)
must resolve to the source rejection pair (privileged / sacrificed /
verbatim) that justified the claim — visible inline, hover-revealable
in :title, click-expandable via native <details>.
