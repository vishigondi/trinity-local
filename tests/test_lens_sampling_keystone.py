"""#263 keystone: the auto lens build/refresh must route its Claude stages
through MCP sampling instead of burning `claude -p` quota.

Two things make that work, and these tests pin both:

1. The kicks fire on the FIRST TOOL CALL (where a session is registered),
   not at server startup (before any session exists). A startup-time kick
   could never sample — that was the bug.
2. The build thread inherits the active-sampling ContextVar via
   copy_context(), so a Claude stage running inside it sees the session.
