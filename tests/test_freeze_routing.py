"""Tests for `freeze_routing_to_disk` — the writer that materializes the
on-demand personal routing table into `~/.trinity/memories/routing.json`.

routing.json is one of the user-facing model-selection memories surfaced
in the memory viewer. Phase 5 distill no longer reads it — picks/routing
are scoreboards, not cognitive shape — but the freeze writer still has to
produce a valid file (or skip cleanly when empty) so the viewer and any
external tooling can read it.
