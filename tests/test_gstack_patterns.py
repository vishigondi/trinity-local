"""Reliability patterns lifted from garrytan/gstack (2026-05-27 audit).

Three patterns from gstack's `test/` directory map cleanly onto Trinity's
own reliability pain points:

  1. **Executable retirement denylist** (mirrors `test/docs-config-keys.test.ts`):
     scan source + active docs for present-tense references to anything
     in `retired_names.RETIRED`. Trinity already has a denylist (see
     `tests/test_doc_count_consistency.py::TestDroppedTermsAreNotReintroduced`)
     but it's hand-maintained — this test wires the registry directly so
     adding a retirement entry instantly grows the guard.

  2. **CLI capability-coverage audit** (mirrors `test/e2e-harness-audit.test.ts`):
     filesystem scan of `src/trinity_local/commands/*.py` registers every
     argparse subcommand and asserts each has at least one test file that
     mentions it. Catches the "shipped a verb without a test" failure mode
     before it ships.

  3. **Two-tier test split** (mirrors gstack's free vs `EVALS=1` shards):
     a marker-based split between cheap (always-run) and expensive
     (opt-in via `TRINITY_SLOW=1`) tests. Tests that hit real Chrome, real
     MLX, or real provider subprocesses get the `slow` marker. Default
     `pytest -q` stays fast; CI runs both shards.

The shapes are stolen; the wiring is Trinity-specific (Python + pytest
instead of TypeScript + bun:test). See `docs/CUT-CANDIDATES.md` Category D
+ docs/historical/sweep-patterns.md for the prior catch-22: every doc-
drift bug a hand-written guard catches is a fix-once shape; every
registry-driven guard catches *future* drifts of the same shape too.
