"""Phase 8 integration tests — exercise the full extension transition
pipeline end-to-end across the layer boundaries we built in Phases 1-7.

Each unit test pinned one layer. These integrations exercise the
contracts BETWEEN layers — the cross-layer invariants that no single
layer test could catch alone:

  1. install-extension persists settings → launchpad pageData reads
     them → dispatch_readiness reports them → doctor surfaces them.
  2. The Native Messaging frame protocol (4-byte LE length + JSON
     body) round-trips through a real subprocess invocation of
     trinity-local-capture-host with `--help` as a benign safe action.
  3. The 11-tier dispatch flow's data contract: the same payload
     shape the launchpad JS emits matches what capture_host parses.
  4. Public CLI surface includes every install-* command the
     MIGRATION doc references — drift principle #21.

These are the regression guards for "did Phase X break Phase X-1's
contract" — the failure mode an isolated unit test cannot see.
