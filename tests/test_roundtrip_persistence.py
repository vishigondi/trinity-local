"""Round-trip persistence invariants — #190 (gstack ratchet).

For every dataclass that has BOTH `to_dict()` and `from_dict()`, the
serialization boundary must round-trip: an instance written to disk
and read back is the same instance. These five types are Trinity's
load-bearing persistence boundaries — PromptNode + TurnWindow index
the corpus, CouncilChainStep + CouncilRoutingLabel are the council
outcome shapes the personal routing table trains on, and RegistryEntry
is the durable tension registry the accumulating lens reads/writes
(#197).

Why only these: a scan during #190 found ~50 classes with `to_dict()`
but only a handful with a matching `from_dict()`. The rest are
serialize-out only (JSON output for the launchpad / share cards /
analytics — never deserialized), so round-trip is N/A. The guard
TestRoundTripCoverageMatchesScan pins the ratio: if someone adds a
`from_dict` to a new class, this test fails until they add it to
ROUND_TRIPPABLE so the round-trip invariant covers it too.

The round-trip property tested is idempotent serialization:
`to_dict(from_dict(to_dict(x))) == to_dict(x)`. This is robust to
the empty-field filtering in to_dict + default-coercion in from_dict
(a fully-default instance's to_dict drops empties, from_dict re-adds
defaults — the SECOND to_dict is the canonical form, and re-loading
it must be stable). For fully-populated instances with canonical
provider slugs, direct object equality also holds — pinned where
applicable.
