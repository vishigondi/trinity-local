"""Tests for the CLI-side embedder gate that surfaces the ~600 MB model
download as an upfront actionable message instead of a mid-command
surprise.

Pairs with the launchpad "Build deeper memory" card (test_embedder_
status_card.py): both surfaces use the same HF cache probe and both
present the same download command. The CLI gate fails fast — the
user sees the message in <100ms instead of after a multi-minute
CLI startup + an HF_HUB_OFFLINE error mid-Phase-1.
