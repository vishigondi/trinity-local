"""Output-shape smoke tests for live record/file producers — #193.

The bug class: a feature runs, doesn't crash, and produces EMPTY (or
wrong-shaped) output. Unit tests on the internals pass; only feeding
realistic input through the whole producer and asserting the output is
non-empty catches it. The #191 history audit found this class twice in
shipped code:
  - 030bad4: memory-compare silently returned 0/0 on real installs
  - the moves substrate: gate ran, zero promotions, substrate dormant

Both producers were retired, so these smokes target the LIVE ones:
  - build_eval_set (the eval harness entry)
  - stage4_post_filter (the lens-build final stage that writes lenses)

Each producer gets two smokes:
  1. realistic non-empty input → NON-EMPTY output (the core guard)
  2. empty/absent input → fails loudly OR returns empty — never
     silently fabricates garbage

These are deterministic (no LLM, no embedder-dependent path under the
count-only default), so they run on any backend.
