# Security policy

Trinity Local is local-first by architecture. Most "security" in our threat model is
*privacy* — the user's transcripts and council outcomes should never leave their
machine without an explicit opt-in. If you find a bug that violates that commitment,
it's a P0 for us regardless of severity in the traditional security sense.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately via **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**:
<https://github.com/vishigondi/trinity-local/security/advisories/new>. This keeps the
report confidential between you and the maintainer until a fix ships — no email infra
needed, and you get a private thread plus optional draft advisory.

Include if applicable:
- Affected Trinity version (`trinity-local --version`)
- Repro steps or a minimal example
- What the user-visible impact is
- Suggested fix (optional)

We aim to acknowledge within 5 business days. Coordinated disclosure preferred for issues
that could affect users in the wild.

## Threat model

What Trinity defends against (in priority order):

1. **Prompt content leaving the user's machine.** Highest priority. The
   `telemetry.py` module is the single audit surface for anything that crosses the
   wire. Council fan-out happens directly from the user's CLI subprocess to the
   provider's API — Trinity is not in the data path for those calls.

2. **Stale MCP servers overwriting state with old code.** `write_live_council_page()`
   is skip-if-exists by default; only `trinity-local portal-html` (CLI) passes
   `force=True`. Long-running MCP servers running pre-upgrade code can no longer
   clobber the on-disk launchpad with stale templates.

3. **Folder ownership.** The installer (`scripts/install.sh`) creates
   `~/.trinity/code/` (with a back-compat symlink at `~/.claude/skills/trinity/`
   for users on the pre-2026-05-19 path) and `~/.local/bin/` wrappers with
   default umask. Trinity's
   own state directory (`~/.trinity/`) is created on first invocation; permissions
   inherit from the user's umask. Set umask 077 or `chmod 700 ~/.trinity/` if you want
   tighter isolation from other local users.

4. **CLI subprocess auth boundaries.** Trinity dispatches to `claude`, `codex`,
   `agy` CLIs via `subprocess.Popen` with explicit argv. We do not pass user-provided
   strings as shell arguments without explicit quoting. The `runtime_env.py` module
   (`run_with_runtime_env()` + the PATH-injection helpers) is the single audit surface
   for shell-execution patterns.

What Trinity does NOT defend against (out of scope):

- **Compromised provider CLIs.** If `claude` / `codex` / `agy` (the Antigravity CLI,
  slug `antigravity`) is malicious, Trinity can't help — the user's prompt is already
  being sent to the wrong place by definition. Verify your provider CLI integrity via
  official package distribution channels. (The legacy Google CLI binary is no longer a
  dispatch target; Trinity reads `~/.gemini/` for *ingest only* and routes new questions
  through `agy` after task #127's 2026-05-21 migration.)

- **Compromised user machine.** If a process on the user's machine has read access to
  `~/.trinity/`, it has read access to everything Trinity knows. We don't encrypt at
  rest (the `lens` is meaningless without the user's logged-in OS session).

- **Network adversaries on the path between the user and the provider's API.** That's
  the provider's TLS configuration's problem, not Trinity's.

## Disclosure timeline

For confirmed vulnerabilities affecting Trinity Local's privacy commitments:

| Day | Step |
|---|---|
| 0 | Report received, acknowledged within 5 business days |
| 7 | Reproducer + scope confirmed |
| 14 | Fix in PR (private branch if needed) |
| 30 | Public patch release + CVE if applicable |
| 90 | Full public disclosure (if requested by reporter) |

For non-security bugs (functional issues, UX bugs, etc.), open a regular GitHub issue.

## Hall of thanks

Security researchers who help us hold the privacy line will be acknowledged here (with
permission). Trinity's wedge is *"your prompts and the models' answers never leave your
machine"* — defending that commitment is core to the project.
